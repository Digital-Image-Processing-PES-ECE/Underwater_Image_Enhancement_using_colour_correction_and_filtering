# Underwater Image Enhancement Using Colour Correction And Filtering

### Project Description:
#### Summary -  
Our project focuses on **underwater image enhancement** using color space transformation and histogram equalization. By converting images to an appropriate color space and applying histogram equalization, we improved contrast, restored natural colors, and corrected red wavelength attenuation. This method enhances image clarity and visibility, making it valuable for applications in underwater exploration, marine research, and robotics.

#### Course concepts used - 
1. - White Balancing
2. - Histogram Equalization
3. - Dehazing
4. - Dark Channel Prior
5. - Red Channel Compensation
6. - Edge Sharpening using Sobel filters
   
#### Dataset - UIEB
About Dataset
950 real underwater images, used for image enhancement, image generation, etc.

#### Novelty - 
1. - Using White Balancing as a pres-processing step before applying the various filters to improve the enhancement quaality.
2. - Applying the techniques discussed on R, G and B channels separately instead of Grayscale image processing.
